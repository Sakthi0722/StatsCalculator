#***MEDIAN***


The median of a sample of numeric data is the value that lies in the middle when we sort the data. The data may be sorted in ascending or descending order, the median remains the same.

To find the median, we need to:

*1. Sort the Sample in ascending order*

*2. Locate the value in the middle of the sorted sample*


When locating the number in the middle of a sorted sample, we can face two kinds of situations:

*1. If the sample has an odd number of observations, then the middle value in the sorted sample is the median.*

>Example: for **[1,2,3,4,5]** the median is **3**

*2. If the sample has an even number of observations, then we'll need to calculate the mean of the two middle values in the sorted sample.*

>Example: for **[1,2,3,4,5,6]** the median is **(3+4/2=)3.5**
