#***MODE***


The mode is the most frequent observation (or observations) in a sample.

The mode is commonly used for categorical data. Common categorical data types are:

+ **boolean** - Can take only two values like in true or false, male or female
+ **nominal** - Can take more than two values like in American - European - Asian - African
+ **ordinal** - Can take more than two values but the values have a logical order like in few - some - many


Consider the given observation1: [9,6,5,4,6,6,9,2,1,9,9,9,9,7]

>For observation1, the mode is **9**, as it appears the most number of times


Consider the given observation2: [6,5,4,6,9,2,1,7,8,8,3]

>For observation2, the mode is **6** and **8** because they're the values that appear more often and both appear the same number of times.
