#***Sample Size***

A sample is a percentage of the total population in statistics. You can use the data from a sample to make inferences about a population as a whole.

A sample size is a part of the population chosen for a survey or experiment.

*For example, you might take a survey of dog owner’s brand preferences. You won’t want to survey all the millions of dog owners in the country, so you take a sample size. That may be several thousand owners. The sample size is a representation of all dog owner’s brand preferences. If you choose your sample wisely, it will be a good representation.*

>Finding a sample size can be one of the most challenging tasks in statistics and depends upon many factors including the size of your original population.
