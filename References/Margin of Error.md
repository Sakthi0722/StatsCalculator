#***Margin of Error***


A margin of error tells you how many percentage points your results will differ from the real population value. For example, a 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time.

More technically, the margin of error is the range of values below and above the sample statistic in a confidence interval. The confidence interval is a way to show what the uncertainty is with a certain statistic.

***Steps to calculate Margin of Error***

**Step 1**: Find the critical value. The critical value is either a t-score or a z-score. If you aren’t sure, see: T-score vs z-score. In general, for small sample sizes (under 30) or when you don’t know the population standard deviation, use a t-score. Otherwise, use a z-score.

**Step 2**: Find the Standard Deviation or the Standard Error. These are essentially the same thing, only you must know your population parameters in order to calculate standard deviation.

**Step 3**: Multiply the critical value from Step 1 by the standard deviation or standard error from Step 2.
For example, if your CV is 1.95 and your SE is 0.019, then:

1.95 * 0.019 = 0.03705

***Example***

900 students were surveyed and had an average GPA of 2.7 with a standard deviation of 0.4. Calculate the margin of error for a 90% confidence level.

1. The critical value is 1.645
2. The standard deviation is 0.4, but as this is a sample, we need the standard error for the mean. he formula for the SE of the mean is Standard Deviation divided by square root of sample size.

Which is, 0.4 / 30 = 0.013 (30 is the square root of 900)

3. 1.645 * 0.013 = 0.021385

Thus, is the calculation of Margin of Error.
