#***Random Number Generation***

Random number generation (RNG) is a process which, through a device, generates a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by a random chance.

Random number generators can be:

* **true random-number generators (TRNGS)** and/or **hardware random-number generators (HRNGS)**, which generate random numbers as a function of current value of some physical environment attribute that is constantly changing in a manner that is practically impossible to model, 

OR

* **pseudo-random number generators (PRNGS)**, which generate numbers that look random, but are actually deterministic, and can be reproduced if the state of the PRNG is known.
