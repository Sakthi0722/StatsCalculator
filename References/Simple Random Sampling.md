#***Simple Random Sampling***

A simple random sample is a set of n objects in a population of N objects where all possible samples are equally likely to happen.

Here’s a basic example of how to get a simple random sample.

*Put 100 numbered bingo balls into a bowl (this is the population N). Select 10 balls from the bowl without looking (this is your sample n). Note that it’s important not to look as you could (unknowingly) bias the sample. While the “lottery bowl” method can work fine for smaller populations, in reality you’ll be dealing with much larger populations.*

>Outline the steps for obtaining a simple random sample for outcomes of strokes in U.S. trauma hospitals.

**Step 1**: Make a list of all the trauma hospitals in the U.S.

**Step 2**: Assign a sequential number to each trauma center (1,2,3…n). This is your sampling frame (the list from which you draw your simple random sample).

**Step 3**: Figure out what your sample size is going to be.

**Step 4**: Use a random number generator to select the sample, using your sampling frame (population size) from Step 2 and your sample size from Step 3.

For example, if your sample size is 50 and your population is 500, generate 50 random numbers between 1 and 500.
